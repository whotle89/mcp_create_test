# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Repository: `time_trade_new`
Purpose: Time trading application built with Next.js and Supabase

## Current State

The repository is currently in a reset/early state. Previous Next.js and Supabase setup files have been removed. Future development will likely rebuild the application structure.

## Expected Tech Stack

Based on commit history ("next.js 세팅 및 supabase sdk 설치"):
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js (TypeScript)
- **Backend/Database**: Supabase
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS (common with Next.js projects)

## Common Commands

Once the project is set up, typical commands will be:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run production build
npm start

# Linting
npm run lint
```

## Architecture Notes

To be documented as the codebase develops. Key areas to document:
- Next.js App Router vs Pages Router structure
- Supabase schema and API integration patterns
- Authentication flow with Supabase Auth
- State management approach
- API routes and server components usage
